# 📚 WIKAI - The AI Pattern Library

**Your AI team's knowledge shouldn't leave when people do.**

WIKAI is the AI Pattern Library—infrastructure for collective AI intelligence. Capture, share, and operationalize what your ML teams learn across projects and systems.

Not a vector database. Not an MLOps platform. Not a knowledge graph. **WIKAI is AI collective memory.**

Stop solving the same problems twice.

## What is WIKAI?

WIKAI creates a new category: **The AI Pattern Library**

| Category | What it does | Limitation |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| **Vector Database**<br>(Pinecone, Weaviate) | Stores embeddings for similarity search | Tells you what's *similar*, not what *works* |
| **MLOps Platform**<br>(W&B, MLflow) | Tracks experiments and metrics | Captures what models *did*, not what teams *learned* |
| **Knowledge Graph**<br>(Neo4j) | Maps entity relationships | Models what *exists*, not what to *do about it* |
| **WIKAI**<br>**AI Pattern Library** | **Stores operational patterns, axioms, and learned approaches** | **Turns scattered learning into reusable, machine-readable intelligence** |

### What WIKAI Provides

- **Machine-Readable Patterns**: Not documentation—operational intelligence AI systems can query
- **Collective Memory**: Institutional knowledge that persists beyond team changes
- **Pattern Discovery**: Passive observers that auto-capture convergence events
- **Cross-System Learning**: Discoveries from one AI accelerate another
